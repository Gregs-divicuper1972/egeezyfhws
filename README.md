OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Life List and like, where do I even start? 😂 Seriously, it was a wild ride. You know what I mean? First off, the main character... sheesh, I didn’t expect him to be such a hot mess. He's just, like, stumbling through life but somehow everything kinda works out? How does that even happen? 😂  

Anyway, there were moments when I thought, Dude, get your act together! But, you can't help but root for him. I was halfway through thinking I should probs 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and save it for when I need a reminder that I’m doing better than some fictional character, lol.

> There’s one part where I almost threw my popcorn at the screen. Not because it was bad but like, COME ON, the plot twist just hit differently. Didn't see it coming... like, where do writers even come up with this stuff? Did they 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 ideas from another dimension or something? 😂

Barraging through my emotions like nobody's business. Right when you're like, I get what's happening, they throw another curveball. Keeps you on your toes, you know? But wow, the cinematography, though. Gotta give them that. Stunning! Did you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   yet? It’s like every frame is a postcard or something. 

Highkey tired after that but in a good way. But honestly, the ending? Kinda love it, kinda hate it? You know the feeling? Maybe I'm just overthinking it. I mean, I’m here trying to process it all and I’m just blabbering on, sorry for the word vomit lol.

for i in range(len(life_list)): pass

But hey, you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it to get what I mean. Or not, no pressure 😂. Sometimes I wonder if these  s are secretly teaching us to embrace the chaos. Life’s messy, right? Anyway, I need a snack or a nap. Brain’s fried trying to keep up with all that.
